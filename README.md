# Neocortex Engine

The Neocortex Engine is a Java-based implementation of the d20 System, a role-playing game system published by Wizards of the Coast for the 3rd edition of Dungeons & Dragons.
It's an API that let's you manage characters, items (like weapons, armor, etc.) or spells and enforces the rules when these entities interact, for example during a combat round.
Furthermore it is a framework that let's you design your own game entities, like more character classes, skills, feats or even monsters.
It aims to implement all such elements given in the d20 system reference document in the future. For an overview over the rule system you can visit The Hypertext d20 SRD (http://www.d20srd.org/) which is a very good resource.

The Neocortex Engine is **not** an RPG game in itself. It is the rules engine that can be used to power a game implementation legislatively. However, you can nonetheless play a little with it and have some fun on a textual basis, like it is shown in the JUnit integration tests. The implementation of such a game is planned for the future as an independent project.

### Design Aims

### General Architecture

Domain, Services, Facades

## Getting started

some mvn commands, position of the log output files and what they contain

## Entity Design

design of a feat -> d20 source text / spring bean xml for comparison
design of a weapon -> spring bean xml

## Example

currently only runs in integration tests
integration test case
log output result

## Completion Status

Something not mentioned has not been started yet.

## Future Aims

other rule systems like Pathfinder SRD
3d frontend, datastore

## Contributing

code quality rules:
checkstyle, pmd, findbugs, sonarQube, unit test coverage

## Project Naming

functions of the neocortex from english wikipedia

## License
